# Power BI Dashboard — Ontario Highway Traffic Patterns & Congestion Trends

## Overview
This project showcases an **interactive Power BI dashboard** developed to analyze **Ontario collision and highway traffic patterns**, with a focus on identifying congestion trends, temporal patterns, and contributing factors using public-sector transportation data.

The dashboard represents my **primary individual contribution**, designed to support intuitive exploration and data-driven insights through effective visualization and storytelling.

## Power BI Dashboard (Primary Contribution)

The Power BI dashboard was **individually designed and developed by me** and focuses on:

- Visualizing collision and traffic trends across time
- Highlighting congestion indicators and seasonal patterns
- Enabling interactive exploration through filters and slicers
- Applying data visualization best practices for clarity and insight

📊 **Dashboard file:**  
`dashboard/ontario_highway_traffic_dashboard.pbix`

## Dashboard Preview & Analytical Features

The dashboard includes analytical features developed beyond raw data visualization:

- Custom **DAX measures** to aggregate collision data by region
- Derived **risk categories** (Low / Medium / High) created from raw attributes
- Region-level analysis to highlight high-risk patterns
- Interactive slicers to explore trends across dimensions
