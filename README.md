# Power BI Dashboard : Ontario Highway Traffic Patterns & Congestion Trends

## Overview
This project showcases an **interactive Power BI dashboard** developed to analyze **Ontario collision and highway traffic patterns**, with a focus on identifying congestion trends, temporal patterns, and contributing factors using public-sector transportation data.

The dashboard represents my **primary individual contribution**, designed to support intuitive exploration and data-driven insights through effective visualization and storytelling.

## Power BI Dashboard (Primary Contribution)

The Power BI dashboard was **individually designed and developed by me** and focuses on analyzing **Ontario collision risk patterns** using derived metrics and categorical analysis.

Key contributions include:
- Designing and implementing **custom DAX measures** to model collision risk
- Creating **region groupings** from raw geographic data
- Developing **risk categories (Low / Medium / High)** from unstructured collision attributes
- Building an interactive dashboard to explore collision risk by region and risk level
- Applying data visualization best practices to support strategic risk assessment

 **Dashboard file:**  
`dashboard/ontario_highway_traffic_dashboard.pbix`

## Dashboard Preview & Analytical Features

The dashboard transforms raw collision data into actionable risk insights by:
- Aggregating collision data at the **regional level**
- Assigning **risk categories** based on derived collision metrics
- Allowing users to interactively explore high-risk areas for strategic planning
