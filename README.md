# Power BI Dashboard — Ontario Highway Traffic Patterns & Congestion Trends

## Overview
This project showcases an **interactive Power BI dashboard** developed to analyze **Ontario collision and highway traffic patterns**, with a focus on identifying congestion trends, temporal patterns, and contributing factors using public-sector transportation data.

The dashboard represents my **primary individual contribution**, designed to support intuitive exploration and data-driven insights through effective visualization and storytelling.
